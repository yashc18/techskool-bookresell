The once harmonious community falls prey to fear and communalism and this feeling lurks throughout the novel. Human emotions are depicted in the rawest form possible, and the character development is spot on.</p>

                      <p class="leading-relaxed text-base">A girl named Biniya receives a beautiful blue umbrella from some Japanese tourists. The local shopkeeper soon gets obsessed with the umbrella and makes up his mind to acquire it at any cost. The story seems to be focused on such a simple and trivial matter. But it is much more profound than it appears to be, just like every other work of Ruskin Bond. The secret to Bond’s success in the book business is that he writes stories that are loved by people of all ages, and sells them at very low costs. A copy of The Blue Umbrella can be bought at a price as low as 60 rupees.</p>
